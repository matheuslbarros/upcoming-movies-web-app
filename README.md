# Upcoming Movies Web App

> As a full stack software developer you've been tasked with the development of an webapp for cinephiles and movie hobbyists. This first version (MVP) of the app will be very simple and limited to showing the list of upcoming movies. The app will be fed with content from The Movie Database (TMDb). No design specs were given, so you're free to follow your UX and UI personal preferences. The front-end for this app should be simple, so try to keep all the business logic on the back-end, including access to the TMDb API. As mentioned before, all data must come from TMDb, but feel free to create your own data storage strategy. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
